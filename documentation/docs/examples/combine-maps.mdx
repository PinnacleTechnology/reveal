title: Combine 3D models with maps
description: Reveal 3D models can be combined with simple 2D maps.

Often it's useful to use 3D models together with traditional maps or satellite imagery. Since Reveal supports
adding custom 3D objects these can be combined in the viewer.

## Simple map overlay using a textured rectangle

The simplest way to add a map in Reveal is by simply adding a rectangle to the scene and texturing it with a
map image. This gives a static map with a fixed resolution, but is easy to set up.

```jsx runnable
// Defined outside this example
const textureUrl = kvaernerVerdalUrl;

const modelBbox = model.getModelBoundingBox();
const modelCenter = modelBbox.getCenter(new THREE.Vector3());

const mapTexture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load(
    textureUrl,
    (texture) => {
      texture.wrapS = texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
    }
  );
// 1300x1300 meters rectangle
const rectangle = new THREE.PlaneBufferGeometry(1300, 1300);
const mapMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: mapTexture });
const map = new THREE.Mesh(rectangle, mapMaterial);
map.rotation.set(-Math.PI / 2.0, 0.0, 0.0);
// Note! Positioning is fake and only serves example purposes
map.position.set(380, -75, 50);
window.map = map;
viewer.addObject3D(map);
```
