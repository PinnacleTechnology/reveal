describe: Applying styles to nodes based on date with Play & Stop
---

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/docs/components/DemoWrapper';

Reveal allows for applying styles to nodes based on date property.


:::note
The test model used in the documentation site is lacking good node properties and the quality of 
the examples shown is therefor restricted as a result of this. To best utilize the filtering APIs 
we recommend providing a rich 3D models with a good set of high-quality attributes associated with 
the nodes.

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

## Show all pipes

If nodes in the 3D model has an attribute `'PDMS.Type'`, `PropertyFilterNodeCollection` can be used to
retrieve nodes of a certain type. In the following example, only pipes are accepted:

```js runnable
// import { NodeCollectionBase, DefaultNodeAppearance } from '@cognite/reveal';
// import { TimelineTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const nodes = new AssetNodeCollection(sdk, model);

const timeline = new TimelineTool(viewer, model);
timeline.createKeyFrame(10000, nodes, { renderGhosted: false, outlineColor: NodeOutlineColor.Cyan });
timeline.createKeyFrame(20000, nodes, { renderGhosted: true, outlineColor: NodeOutlineColor.Orange });

timeline.play(2000, 1000, 40000);
```
